1) Great work giving 10 GB volume size but, it should be t3 instead of t2 in launch config.
    The Instances already t3.medium (except the bastion host) and you can check the image in the repo (t3-intances.jpg)
    and the parameters file (udagram-infra.json).
    
2) As per the rubric, You need to remove keyname property from the launch config. :v: 
Since, we do not want any outside access to our instance, So that is why the keyname property should be removed.
    I attached the keyname in the launch config so I can access the private web servers from the bastion host in the
    public subnet, but I restricted the SSH access only from inside the VPC, Hence there's no public access.
    you can find the security group image in the repo (security-group.jpg).
